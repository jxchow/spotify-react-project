# Title: Minimalist Spotify

**Team Members:** Brian Ho, Sheryl Chang, Julian Chow, Diana Tu

**Demo Link (optional)**: [reactdecal.org](http://reactdecal.org) 

**Prompt:** Spotify Client

## **Abstract**
The app utilizes the Spotify API and is essentially a minimalist spotify app where you can search, queue, play, skip, and pause songs. You can create a playlist on demand and then it plays from your Spotify app. In terms of packages we use the Spotify JS wrapper and also Material-UI.

## Components**:**

The Login component prompts the user to log in with their spotify account. The Music player component lets the user play/pause/skip to next for the songs. The Queue manages and displays the current queue of songs that were added and that are up next. The Search bar allows you to search for songs and then add them to the Queue. The CurrentlyPlaying component lets you manage which song is currently playing and displays it in the center of the screen.

## **Features:**

We can add songs to a queue and then play from the top of the queue with the play button. The app shows the song image, name, and artist and then you can play, pause or skip to next song.

## **Division of Labor:**

- Brian: Used the Spotify API to make search function
- Sheryl: Made the music player components
- Julian: Made the queue functionality 
- Diana: helped with some CSS design aspects
